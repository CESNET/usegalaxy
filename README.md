# MetaCentrum Galaxy Ansible Playbook

This playbook installs and configures Galaxy server on Metacentrum CZ infrastructure.

## requirements

- You need to have `ansible`. Python virtualenv is a recommended way to its installation.

- These ports enabled on host machine:
```
80(HTTP)
443(HTTPS)
4369(TCP)
5671(TCP)
15672(TCP)
25672(TCP)
```

- Metacentrum service account (in the following examples `galaxy-qa1` is used)
- OIDC client id and secret set up for federated login with proper scopes

## auth with the playbook

Use your existing ssh key or generate a new one with `$ ssh-keygen -t ed25519`

- If you want to run the playbook through github action you need to add your key to your github profile.
- For executing this from a local machine you can forward your sshkey to the host.

## add a host

For the purposes below the `<YOUR_HOST>` can be e.g. `galaxy-qa2.galaxy.cloud.e-infra.cz`

Add an entry to the `hosts.yml` file which could look like this:

```
galaxyservers:
  hosts:
    <YOUR_HOST>:
      ansible_user: debian
```

## create vars file for your host

Create `host_vars/<YOUR_HOST>/vars.yml`.
Check out the `vars.yml` files of other hosts in this repo to get an idea of what are the options.

note: The same service user (`galaxy-qa1`) is used for both `pulsar-qa1` and `pulsar-qa2` instances.

## create and fill ansible vault

generate password with `$ openssl rand -base64 24 > .vault-password.txt`

create vault for your host `ansible-vault create host_vars/<YOUR_HOST>/secret.yml`

The vault should contain the following vars:

```yml
vault_id_secret: choose_something_unique_per_instance
rabbitmq_users_password:
  mqadmin: a-really-long-password-here
  pulsar: a-really-long-DIFFERENT-password-here
vault_rabbitmq_password_galaxy: good-password-here
einfracz_client_id: string-with-client-id
einfracz_client_secret: string-with-client-secret

# Galaxy admin API key for tool installation
api_key: dont-be-lazy-a-really-long-password-here
# see https://github.com/galaxyproject/galaxy/blob/dev/doc/source/admin/special_topics/vault.md
vault_encryption_keys:
- generated_key_NUDIABSUmny78sad8a7sby87av8dv=
pulsar_ssh_key: |
  -----BEGIN OPENSSH PRIVATE KEY-----
  asdasdasdad
  -----END OPENSSH PRIVATE KEY-----
```

## running playbook
`$ ansible-playbook --limit <YOUR_HOST> galaxy.yml`

## creating service users

At the moment our playbooks assume there is an admin's API key, so after a first run the vault needs to be updated with such a key.

You also need to create a non-admin service user called `galaxy@cesnet.cz` for running tool tests and other non-admin automated tasks.

## tools

Instances' tools are managed by a combination of a cron script that installs them (deployed from this playbook) -- check out `[`the script`](templates/galaxy/cron/install_tools.sh.j2)
and external repository that contains the lists of tools for every instance: https://github.com/CESNET/galaxy_tools.

## deployment troubleshooting

Following are troubleshooting notes gathered through the learning process.


### client build OOM

- stop app before building
- do not build maps (`make client-production` only)
- set reasonable heap (e.g. `NODE_OPTIONS: --max_old_space_size=4096`)
- disable webpack parallel minimizer

### glibc

On ubuntu < 22.04 and Debian < 12 the GLIBC version is incompatible with the ```galaxyproject.tusd``` GLIBC, therefore playbook ends in error.
- in `roles/galaxyproject.tusd/defaults/main.yml` you have to set the `tusd_version:` to 'v1.8.0' (tested, possibly higher)

### debian 11

On Debian 11 the default version of `ansible` is 2.10.08 which fails to extract binaries for TUSd.
- workaround:
  - `sudo vim /etc/apt/sources.list` add this line : `deb http://ppa.launchpad.net/ansible/ansible/ubuntu focal main`
  - then `sudo apt-key adv --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv-keys 93C4A3FD7BB9C367`
  - followed by `sudo apt-get update` and `sudo apt-get install ansible -y`
- Note that you might need to `sudo apt remove ansible` `sudo apt autoremove` before you try to install ansible.

### rabbitmq python

Use `sudo apt install python3-docker` before running the `usegalaxy.rabbitmqserver` role.

### influxdb

For influxdb apt key error: https://www.influxdata.com/blog/linux-package-signing-key-rotation/

### flower

Flower role 2.0 tries to install python `virtualenv` globally, which debian12 does not allow. You have to modify the role to prevent this.
